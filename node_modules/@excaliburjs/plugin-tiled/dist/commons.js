    /*
    SequenceMatcher is a flexible class for comparing pairs of sequences of
    any type, so long as the sequence elements are hashable.  The basic
    algorithm predates, and is a little fancier than, an algorithm
    published in the late 1980's by Ratcliff and Obershelp under the
    hyperbolic name "gestalt pattern matching".  The basic idea is to find
    the longest contiguous matching subsequence that contains no "junk"
    elements (R-O doesn't address junk).  The same idea is then applied
    recursively to the pieces of the sequences to the left and to the right
    of the matching subsequence.  This does not yield minimal edit
    sequences, but does tend to yield matches that "look right" to people.

    SequenceMatcher tries to compute a "human-friendly diff" between two
    sequences.  Unlike e.g. UNIX(tm) diff, the fundamental notion is the
    longest *contiguous* & junk-free matching subsequence.  That's what
    catches peoples' eyes.  The Windows(tm) windiff has another interesting
    notion, pairing up elements that appear uniquely in each sequence.
    That, and the method here, appear to yield more intuitive difference
    reports than does diff.  This method appears to be the least vulnerable
    to synching up on blocks of "junk lines", though (like blank lines in
    ordinary text files, or maybe "<P>" lines in HTML files).  That may be
    because this is the only method of the 3 that has a *concept* of
    "junk" <wink>.

    Example, comparing two strings, and considering blanks to be "junk":

    >>> isjunk = (c) -> c is ' '
    >>> s = new SequenceMatcher(isjunk,
                                'private Thread currentThread;',
                                'private volatile Thread currentThread;')

    .ratio() returns a float in [0, 1], measuring the "similarity" of the
    sequences.  As a rule of thumb, a .ratio() value over 0.6 means the
    sequences are close matches:

    >>> s.ratio().toPrecision(3)
    '0.866'

    If you're only interested in where the sequences match,
    .getMatchingBlocks() is handy:

    >>> for [a, b, size] in s.getMatchingBlocks()
    ...   console.log("a[#{a}] and b[#{b}] match for #{size} elements");
    a[0] and b[0] match for 8 elements
    a[8] and b[17] match for 21 elements
    a[29] and b[38] match for 0 elements

    Note that the last tuple returned by .get_matching_blocks() is always a
    dummy, (len(a), len(b), 0), and this is the only case in which the last
    tuple element (number of elements matched) is 0.

    If you want to know how to change the first sequence into the second,
    use .get_opcodes():

    >>> for [op, a1, a2, b1, b2] in s.getOpcodes()
    ...   console.log "#{op} a[#{a1}:#{a2}] b[#{b1}:#{b2}]"
    equal a[0:8] b[0:8]
    insert a[8:8] b[8:17]
    equal a[8:29] b[17:38]

    See the Differ class for a fancy human-friendly file differencer, which
    uses SequenceMatcher both to compare sequences of lines, and to compare
    sequences of characters within similar (near-matching) lines.

    See also function getCloseMatches() in this module, which shows how
    simple code building on SequenceMatcher can be used to do useful work.

    Timing:  Basic R-O is cubic time worst case and quadratic time expected
    case.  SequenceMatcher is quadratic time for the worst case and has
    expected-case behavior dependent in a complicated way on how many
    elements the sequences have in common; best case time is linear.

    Differ is a class for comparing sequences of lines of text, and
    producing human-readable differences or deltas.  Differ uses
    SequenceMatcher both to compare sequences of lines, and to compare
    sequences of characters within similar (near-matching) lines.

    Each line of a Differ delta begins with a two-letter code:

        '- '    line unique to sequence 1
        '+ '    line unique to sequence 2
        '  '    line common to both sequences
        '? '    line not present in either input sequence

    Lines beginning with '? ' attempt to guide the eye to intraline
    differences, and were not present in either input sequence.  These lines
    can be confusing if the sequences contain tab characters.

    Note that Differ makes no claim to produce a *minimal* diff.  To the
    contrary, minimal diffs are often counter-intuitive, because they synch
    up anywhere possible, sometimes accidental matches 100 pages apart.
    Restricting synch points to contiguous matches preserves some notion of
    locality, at the occasional cost of producing a longer diff.

    Example: Comparing two texts.

    >>> text1 = ['1. Beautiful is better than ugly.\n',
    ...   '2. Explicit is better than implicit.\n',
    ...   '3. Simple is better than complex.\n',
    ...   '4. Complex is better than complicated.\n']
    >>> text1.length
    4
    >>> text2 = ['1. Beautiful is better than ugly.\n',
    ...   '3.   Simple is better than complex.\n',
    ...   '4. Complicated is better than complex.\n',
    ...   '5. Flat is better than nested.\n']

    Next we instantiate a Differ object:

    >>> d = new Differ()

    Note that when instantiating a Differ object we may pass functions to
    filter out line and character 'junk'.

    Finally, we compare the two:

    >>> result = d.compare(text1, text2)
    [ '  1. Beautiful is better than ugly.\n',
      '- 2. Explicit is better than implicit.\n',
      '- 3. Simple is better than complex.\n',
      '+ 3.   Simple is better than complex.\n',
      '?   ++\n',
      '- 4. Complex is better than complicated.\n',
      '?          ^                     ---- ^\n',
      '+ 4. Complicated is better than complex.\n',
      '?         ++++ ^                      ^\n',
      '+ 5. Flat is better than nested.\n' ]

      characters, except for at most one splat ('#').  It is recommended
      to leave linejunk null. 

    - `charjunk`: A function that should accept a string of length 1. The
      module-level function `IS_CHARACTER_JUNK` may be used to filter out
      whitespace characters (a blank or tab; **note**: bad idea to include
      newline in this!).  Use of IS_CHARACTER_JUNK is recommended.

      Each sequence must contain individual single-line strings ending with

    Optional keyword parameters `linejunk` and `charjunk` are for filter
    functions (or None):

    - linejunk: A function that should accept a single string argument, and
      return true iff the string is junk.  The default is null, and is

      default is module-level function IS_CHARACTER_JUNK, which filters out
      whitespace characters (a blank or tab; note: bad idea to include newline
      in this!).

    Example:
    >>> a = ['one\n', 'two\n', 'three\n']

 * - `raw` (Boolean) - do raw deflate
 * - `gzip` (Boolean) - create gzip wrapper
 * - `to` (String) - if equal to 'string', then result will be "binary string"

/*
   Decode literal, length, and distance codes and write out the resulting
   literal and match bytes until either not enough input or output is
   available, an end-of-block is encountered, or a data error is encountered.
   When large enough input and output buffers are supplied to inflate(), for
   example, a 16K input buffer and a 64K output buffer, more than 95% of the
   inflate execution time is spent in this routine.

   Entry assumptions:

        state.mode === LEN
        strm.avail_in >= 6
        strm.avail_out >= 258
        start >= strm.avail_out
        state.bits < 8

   On return, state.mode is one of:

        LEN -- ran out of enough output space or enough available input
        TYPE -- reached end of block code, inflate() to interpret next block
        BAD -- error in block data

   Notes:

    - The maximum input bits used by a length/distance pair is 15 bits for the
      length code, 5 bits for the length extra, 15 bits for the distance code,
      and 13 bits for the distance extra.  This totals 48 bits, or six bytes.
      Therefore if strm.avail_in >= 6, then there is enough input to avoid
      checking for available input while decoding.

    - The maximum bytes that a single length/distance pair can output is 258
      bytes, which is the maximum length that can be coded.  inflate_fast()
      requires strm.avail_out >= 258 for each loop to avoid checking for
      output space.

 when a window is already in use, or when output has been written during this
 inflate call, but the end of the deflate stream has not been reached yet.
 It is also called to create a window for dictionary data when a dictionary
 is loaded.

 Providing output buffers larger than 32K to inflate() should provide a speed
 advantage, since only the last 32K of output is copied to the sliding window
 upon return from inflate(), and since all distances after the first 32K of
 output will fall in the output data, making match copies simpler and faster.
 The advantage may be dependent on the size of the processor's data caches.

   Process a set of code lengths to create a canonical Huffman code.  The
   code lengths are lens[0..codes-1].  Each length corresponds to the
   symbols 0..codes-1.  The Huffman code is generated by first sorting the
   symbols by length from short to long, and retaining the symbol order
   for codes with equal lengths.  Then the code starts with all zero bits
   for the first code of the shortest length, and the codes are integer
   increments for the same length, and zeros are appended as the length
   increases.  For the deflate format, these bits are stored backwards
   from their more natural integer increment ordering, and so when the
   decoding tables are built in the large loop below, the integer codes
   are incremented backwards.

   This routine assumes, but does not check, that all of the entries in
   lens[] are in the range 0..MAXBITS.  The caller must assure this.
   1..MAXBITS is interpreted as that code length.  zero means that that
   symbol does not occur in this code.

   The codes are sorted by computing a count of codes for each length,
   creating from that a table of starting indices for each length in the
   sorted table, and then entering the symbols in order in the sorted
   table.  The sorted table is work[], with that space being provided by
   the caller.

   The length counts are used for other purposes as well, i.e. finding
   the minimum and maximum length codes, determining if there are any
   codes at all, checking for a valid set of lengths, and looking ahead
   at length counts to determine sub-table sizes when building the
   decoding tables.

   Create and fill in decoding tables.  In this loop, the table being
   filled is at next and has curr index bits.  The code being used is huff
   with length len.  That code is converted to an index by dropping drop
   bits off of the bottom.  For codes where len is less than drop + curr,
   those top drop + curr - len bits are incremented through all values to
   fill the table with replicated entries.

   root is the number of index bits for the root table.  When len exceeds
   root, sub-tables are created pointed to by the root entry with an index
   of the low root bits of huff.  This is saved in low to check for when a
   new sub-table should be started.  drop is zero when the root table is
   being filled, and drop is root when sub-tables are being filled.

   When a new sub-table is needed, it is necessary to look ahead in the
   code lengths to determine what size sub-table is needed.  The length
   counts are used for this, and so count[] is decremented as codes are
   entered in the tables.

   used keeps track of how many table entries have been allocated from the
   provided *table space.  It is checked for LENS and DIST tables against
   the constants ENOUGH_LENS and ENOUGH_DISTS to guard against changes in
   the initial root table size constants.  See the comments in inftrees.h
   for more information.

   sym increments through all symbols, and the loop terminates when
   all codes of length max, i.e. all codes, have been processed.  This
   routine permits incomplete codes, so another loop after this one fills
   in the rest of the decoding tables with invalid code markers.
